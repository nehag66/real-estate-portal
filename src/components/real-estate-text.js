        Real-estate delivers the best real estate deals first, well before they
        hit the mass market.
      </b>{" "}
      <br />
      As you know, perfect timing – not just "location, location, location" – is
      critical when it comes to purchasing a new home and/or investment property
      at the right (lowest possible) price. That's because competition drives
      prices up. At Foreclosure.com, we target low-priced distressed deals –
      bank-owned homes, government foreclosures (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD,
      etc.) preforeclosure listings, real estate owned (REO) properties and
      foreclosure auctions, among others – and pass them (and huge savings) onto
      smart homebuyers (that's you!).
      <br />
      <b>
        It's so simple to find the best real estate deals in your area with
        Real-Estate: It's one easy search!
      </b>{" "}
      <br />
      And that search can be performed at the state, county and city levels –
      even the exact address and/or zip code – so that your house hunt hits the
      ground running. Once you start digging into the incredible foreclosure
      deals, each listing will be complete with asking price, exact location,
      number of beds / baths, property type (single-family foreclosure, etc.),
      available photos, tax roll information, helpful neighborhood / school
      district details and so much more. Indeed, we provide as much information
      as possible so that you can make the most informed decision possible.

      <b>
        Real-Estate updates its nationwide database of foreclosure listings at
        least twice EACH DAY!
      </b>{" "}
      <br />
      Not weekly or monthly like other sites out there. This ensures that we
      offer prospective homebuyers and investors with the freshest, hottest
      deals on the Internet. In fact, most of our information comes direct from
      hundreds of corporate sellers and multiple government agencies so that you
      can score the deal of a lifetime – in some cases foreclosed homes for less
      than $60,000! Find cheap homes under $60,000. Whether your looking for a
      single-family home, condo, townhouse, or even searching for mobile homes
      near you, Foreclosure.com keeps the most up-to-date listings of all
      property types. The best part about searching Foreclosure.com is that we
      make the experience so simple that anyone can do it. And if you run into a
      problem or have questions that aren't covered in our "Frequently Asked
      Questions" section, we have a dedicated support staff of actual humans
      (not an endless maze of automated questions) who are knowledgeable and
      eager to help you achieve your American Dream of affordable homeownership.
      Call us today ... or any day!
